Hi,
This is Ishaak, and this is my entry for Hacktoberfest.

You may use the following for improvements:

place() method:It organizes the widgets by placing them on specific positions directed by the programmer.
Canvas: It is used to draw pictures and other complex layout like graphics, text and widgets. This will help in improving layout.
Menu: It is used to create all kinds of menus used by the application. You can reduce the complex layout by using menus in the project
